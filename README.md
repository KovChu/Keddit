Keddit
======

This is a Reddit-like app created with Kotlin that allows user to create topics and perform unlimited upvote and downvote actions.
  
The app will always start up clean as there will not be a persistent database to store the previous data.

The list of the topic will always be sorted and present in order by which the item with most upvote count will be at top
