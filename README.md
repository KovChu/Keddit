Keddit
======

This is a Reddit-like app created with Kotlin that allows user to create topics and perform unlimited upvote and downvote actions.
  
The app will always start up clean as there will not be a persistent database to store the previous data.

New topics can be added by user by clicking the + button on the top right to enter the title

The topics will present in a RecyclerView contains in a Fragment, and will always be sorted and present in order by which the item with most upvote count will be at top

The list will present at most 20 topics, and the extra ones will be hidden

User can click on upVote or downVote in each topic, and the order will change after each click if needed
